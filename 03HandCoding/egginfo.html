        <h2>Egg Terminology</h2>

        <p>Here are some defintions to terms you may come across in your research:</p>

        <dl>
            <dt><strong>yolk</strong></dt>
            <dd>You may know that this is the yellow ball in the middle of the egg, but did you know that the egg yolk
                is there to provide nutrients to
                the developing embryo of the growing chick?
                Not only that, but over half of the nutrition in eggs is stored in the yolk, whether fertilized or
                unfertilized.
                <br>
                Fun Facts:
                <br>
                The color of the yolk is dependent upon the diet of the hen who laid the egg.
                <br>
                Hens can sometimes lay an egg with two yolks. This is commom among young hens whose reproductive cycles
                have not yet been solidified.

            </dd>

            <dt><strong>albumen</strong></dt>
            <dd>It is knows to us by its more popular name, egg whites. The albumen makes up over half of the eggs
                weight.
                It serves as a protection for the egg yolk, and stores over half of the eggs protien.
                <br>
                Fun Fact: The older the egg is, the more translucent the albumen is.
            </dd>

            <dt><strong>bloom</strong></dt>
            <dd>
                The bloom of an egg is a thin, protective layer that is outside the shell. It stops bacteria and dust
                from entering in, and is vital for
                the survival of fertilized eggs. When the egg is washed, rubbed or gets wet, the bloom is washed or
                wiped away.
            </dd>
        </dl>

        <h2 id="eggcolors">Different Egg Colors</h2>

        <p>Chickens lay eggs in several different colors:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>White</li>
            <li>Cream</li>
            <li>Brown (light and dark)</li>
            <li>Olive</li>
            <li>Green</li>
            <li>Blue</li>
            <li>Pink</li>

            <!-- QUOTE FROM BACKYARD POULTRY-->
            <blockquote>
                "There are more than 60 breeds of chickens recognized by the American Poultry
                Association and hundreds of other chicken breeds that have been developed
                worldwide â€” many of whom lay gorgeous eggs in a rainbow of hues
                ranging from white to cream, green, pink, blue and even chocolate brown."

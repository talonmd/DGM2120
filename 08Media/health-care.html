            <h1>Basic Health & Care</h1>

            <h2>The Basics</h2>
            <p>Chickens are hardy birds, and will do well in most environments. There are, however, some basic
                necessities to know before deciding to raise chickens of your own.</p>

            <h4>Food</h4>
            <p>
                An average hen will eat about 1/4 of a pound of food per day. That being said, the best way to feed
                chickens is to always have food available (called a <a
                    href="https://www.gov.mb.ca/agriculture/livestock/production/poultry/poultry-rations-and-feeding-methods.html"
                    target="_blank">'full feeding method'</a>). When hens' feed is
                restricted, the egg quality and ammount typically decreases. There are several types of feed you can
                give to your chickens (see the table below for more information).
            </p>

            <table class="info">
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Feed Type</th>
                        <th>Description & When to Provide</th>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Starter Feeds</td>
                        <td>Starter feeds should be provided to newly hatched chicks (0-10 weeks of age). They are
                            specifically formulated to provide the nutrients needed for the chicks to grow healthily.
                            For meat chickens, the starter feed typically has a much higher protien content.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Grower Feeds</td>
                        <td>After 10 weeks, the chickens feed should be replaced with a grower feed. They have a higher
                            protien content (%15-%16) and are developed to promote growth through the chicks adulthood.
                        </td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Layer Feeds</td>
                        <td>Layer feeds are specifically created to provide the optimal amount of nutrition for laying
                            hens. They have the added nutrient of calcium, for healthy egg shells. Hens should start to
                            be fed this around 16-18 weeks old, or when they first begin to lay eggs. This feed will
                            still work great for chickens who do not lay eggs, although if you are raising them for
                            meat, a feed higher is protien is reccommended.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Scratch</td>
                        <td>Scratch emcompasses feed such as cracked corn, wheat, barely, oats, etc. They do not provide
                            as much protien, nor do they have all the balanced nutrients needed. You can think of it as
                            a 'fast food' for chickens, or a treat that you give them on occassion. If feeding your
                            chickens scratch, this is when it is a good idea to provide them with grit, to help their
                            digestion.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Table Scraps</td>
                        <td>While table scraps are fun to feed to your chickens, they are not nessesarily good as the
                            sole food resource. They certainly help keep your chickens (and you) happy, and will
                            sometimes result in richer egg yolks. If you are feeding your chickens table scraps, be sure
                            to also provide grit so they can crush and digest the foods. One thing to keep in mind with
                            table scraps, is that citrusy foods are not good for chickens and should be avoided.</td>

            <h4>Water</h4>
            <p>
                An average hen will drink about three-times as much water than food per day. It is vital to provide
                enough water for your chickens, especially in the hotter months of the year. It is reccomended to
                provide <em>at least</em> one quart of water per four chickens per day. A constant supply is more highly
                reccommended.
            </p>
            <h4>Supplements</h4>

            </figure>


            <p>
                Chickens might require two types of supplements: Oyster Shell (calcium), and Grit. </p>

            <p>If a laying hen is
                deficient in calcium, then her eggs will have thin, or no, shells. A typical layer feed (see table
                below) should provide enough calcium for your layer hens. If thin shells start to become a problem (or
                your chickens begin eating their own shells), then oyster shell is the most commonly reccommended
                supplement. Mixing in about 2lbs of shell to every 100lbs of layer feed is a good ratio to keep in mind,
                although you can also provide a sepparate feeder with oyster shell, allowing the hens to eat as they
                require it. </p>
            <p>As for grit, it is, simply put, very small rocks that the chickens can eat to help crush the
                foot in their gizzard, which in turn aids in their digestion. <a
                    href="https://www.muranochickenfarm.com/2018/04/chickens-need-grit.html" target="_blank">Check this
                    webiste out</a> if you want to read a detailed description of this process. As the website says, if grit is not provided,
                the chickens will be able to eat rocks from the ground,
                but eventually they could use most all of the available rocks. Layer pellets
                and crumbles are not hard for
                chickens to digest, but if other foods are fed, such as scratch and table scraps, then grit is needed.
            </p>

            <h4>Space</h4>
            <p>
                In order to be both healthy and happy, chickens require enough space. If your chickens do not have
                enough
                space, there will be signs such as: fighting, feather loss, pulling one anothers feathers out, and
                possibly sickness and cannibalism. A good reccommended amount of space per chicken is about 2 square feet in the coop, and 8-10 square feet outside of the coop (in the run). There are
                many differing opinions on this, but we have found that to be more than adequate. Space will also depend

                <span>Auracana</span>
                They are also called Americauna, or more commonly 'Easter Eggers.' 
                They get this nickname because they lay <a href="egginfo.html#eggcolors">blue, green, or sometimes even pink</a> colored eggs.

            <figcaption>
                <span>Bantam</span>
                Rather than a breed, bantam refers to a certain type of chicken.
                Bantam chickens are smaller chickens, meaning, when they are fully grown they are 1/4 to 1/2 the size of
                a regular chicken. This results in much smaller eggs, as well.

            <figcaption>
                <span>Brahma</span>
                Brahmas are one of the largest chickens. Fully grown, the males can be up to 10 pounds. 
                Brahmas don't lay eggs as often (or as large) as an average chicken would, however.

        <figure class="chicken-gallery">
            <img class="chicken-gallery-image" src="images/frizzle.jpg" alt= "picture of a chicken with frizzle feather type">
            <figcaption>
                <span>Frizzle</span>
                Rather than a breed, frizzle refers to a feather type. This type of feather bends outward at the end,
                resulting in a 'puffy' appearance. 
                There are several breeds that can have the frizzle feathers.

        <figure class="chicken-gallery">
            <img class="chicken-gallery-image" src="images/orphington.jpg" alt= "picture of an orphington chicken">
            <figcaption>
                <span>Orphington</span>
                More commonly known as Buff Orphingtons because of their golden color, Orphingtons are a very solid breed. They are weather hardy, lay well, and are medium sized. 
                Although known for their color, Orphingtons can come in almost any color.

        <figure class="chicken-gallery">
            <img class="chicken-gallery-image" src="images/redstar.jpg" alt= "picture of a red star chicken">
            <figcaption>
                <span>Red Star</span>
                These chickens are light-weight, easy to take care of, and lay <em>a lot</em> of brown eggs.  
                If you want a chicken for it's eggs, buy a Red Star.

        <figure class="chicken-gallery">
            <img class="chicken-gallery-image" src="images/rhodeislandred.jpg" alt= "picture of a rhode island red chicken">
            <figcaption>
                <span>Rhode Island Red</span>
                Rhode Island Reds are similar to the Red Star. They are typically a bit bigger, but still lay eggs extremely well. 
                They are also easily domesticated. They are a deeper, more red color than the Red Star, sometimes with a green shine to their tail feathers.

            <figcaption>
                <span>Wyandotte</span>
                Wyandottes are a very common chicken breed. Their signature is the 'laced' feathers, meaning the edges of each feather is a different color than the middle.
                The two colors they come in are Golden-Laced (white and brown, pictured), and Silver-Laced (white and black).

        <h2>Why have we built this page?</h2>

        <p>
            We have noticed that most of the customer purchasing chicken coops from us also have a lot of
            questions about raising chickens. We want to help all of you out by providing a free, all-emcompasing
            resource
            to help you learn the basics of raising the chickens that you will be housing in the coops that we build.
        </p>

        <h2>Why should I raise chickens?</h2>

        <p>
            In this day and age, people look for pets as a resourse for comfort and companionship. We own dogs, cats,
            guinea pigs, mice, the list goes on.
            Chickens are a wonderful example of another pet we can own that will provide us with those same needs. When
            handled often, they can become accustomed to
            being held, and even follow you around your yard as if you were their mother hen. Some breeds are more
            inclined to being handled than others, but most all can become
            used to it.
        </p>
        <p>
            The last and most pressing point, is <em>eggs!</em> Chickens provide you with eggs, meaning, the money you
            put into their food results in food for yourself.
            We have never heard of anybody who would complain about that. Fun fact for you: chickens on average lay an
            egg every 25 hours, depending on the breed
            (for more egg information <a href="egginfo.html#egginfoheader">click here</a>).
            That means, depending on which <a href="breeds.html">breed you choose,</a> you could end up
            flooded with eggs!
